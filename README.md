## Background
Gold has long been regarded as a reliable safe haven asset, particularly during periods of economic instability, geopolitical tension, and financial crises. It's historical role as a store of value dates back thousands of years, making it one of the most trusted assets in human history. This perception stems from its unique charateristics, including its intrinsic value, rarity, and resistance to inflation and devaluation.

### Behavioral Dynamics in Times of Crisis
During periods of heightened risk, such as wars, recessions, or pandemics, gold prices typically rise as investors seek stability. Gold has also been perceived as a shield against inflation, maintaining purchasing power over time, especially during periods of high inflation or currency devaluation. As a non-correlated asset, gold often performs independently of traditinoal financial markets reducing overall portfolio risk.

### Objective of Report
This report aims to analyze the behavior of COMEX Gold Futures (GC=F) in response to various crises, assessing its performance as a safe haven asset. By understanding these dynamics, we can better evaluate its role in hedging risk and gain insights into predicting market vulnerabilities during periods of uncertainty. To assess overall market activity, we will use a market proxy (S&P 500) to get a general evaluation of the market.

# Executive Summary
This analysis examines the impact of Federal Reserve rate changes on gold (GC=F) and the S&P 500, alongside an evaluation of gold’s beta behavior over time.

- On the day of a Fed rate cut/hike, gold’s daily return increased 3.6% above its average. In the 7-day event window, gold's return surged by 132% relative to its average, reinforcing its role as a safe-haven asset. Conversely, the S&P 500 exhibited a 40% decline from its average daily return during the event window, but on the day of the event itself, it experienced a sharp 282% increase, indicating heightened market volatility.
- Gold's performance differed during specific monetary actions: the average daily return was 0.07% during rate cuts and 0.04% during rate hikes.
- An analysis of gold's beta (GC=F) highlights its variability over time, reflecting its defensive characteristics. Notable movements include a dip to -0.552 in 2007 during the early stages of the financial crisis, showing a negative correlation with the market, and a peak of 0.822 in 2010 during the post-crisis recovery. From 2018–2023, beta exhibited moderate fluctuations, generally remaining below 1, reinforcing gold's role as a risk diversifier with limited sensitivity to broader market trends during volatile periods.
These findings underscore gold’s unique behavior as a safe-haven asset, providing stability and diversification during periods of economic uncertainty and monetary policy shifts.
