## Background
Gold has long been regarded as a reliable safe haven asset, particularly during periods of economic instability, geopolitical tension, and financial crises. It's historical role as a store of value dates back thousands of years, making it one of the most trusted assets in human history. This perception stems from its unique charateristics, including its intrinsic value, rarity, and resistance to inflation and devaluation.

### Behavioral Dynamics in Times of Crisis
During periods of heightened risk, such as wars, recessions, or pandemics, gold prices typically rise as investors seek stability. Gold has also been perceived as a shield against inflation, maintaining purchasing power over time, especially during periods of high inflation or currency devaluation. As a non-correlated asset, gold often performs independently of traditinoal financial markets reducing overall portfolio risk.
